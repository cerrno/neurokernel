Neurokernel is a Python framework for developing models of 
the fruit fly brain and executing them on multiple NVIDIA GPUs.

Prerequisites
-------------
Neurokernel requires 

* Linux (other operating systems may work, but have not been tested);
* Python 2.7 (Python 3.0 is not guaranteed to work);
* at least one NVIDIA GPU with `Fermi
  <http://www.nvidia.com/content/pdf/fermi_white_papers/nvidia_fermi_compute_architecture_whitepaper.pdf>`_
  architecture or later;
* NVIDIA's `GPU drivers <http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/>`_;
* `CUDA <http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html>`_ 5.0 or later;
* `OpenMPI <http://www.open-mpi.org>`_ 1.8.4 or later compiled with CUDA support.

To check what GPUs are in your system, you can use the `inxi 
<https://code.google.com/p/inxi/>`_ command available on most Linux 
distributions::

  inxi -G

You can verify that the drivers are loaded as follows::

  lsmod | grep nvidia

If no drivers are present, you may have to manually load them by running 
something like::

  modprobe nvidia

as root.

See `this page <https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building#easy-build>`_
for OpenMPI installation information. *Note that OpenMPI 1.8* |openmpi_no_windows|_.

.. _openmpi_no_windows: https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.6/ms-windows.php
.. |openmpi_no_windows| replace:: *cannot run on Windows*

Some of Neurokernel's demos require either `ffmpeg <http://www.fmpeg.org>`_ or `libav 
<http://libav.org>`_ installed to generate visualizations.

Installation
------------
Download the latest Neurokernel code as follows: ::

  git clone https://github.com/neurokernel/neurokernel.git

Since Neurokernel requires a fair number of additional Python packages to run,
it is recommended that it either be installed in a `virtualenv
<http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_ or `conda <http://conda.io/>`_
environment. Follow the relevant instructions below.

Virtualenv
^^^^^^^^^^
See `this page <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ for
virtualenv installation information.

Create a new virtualenv environment and install several required dependencies: ::

  cd ~/
  virtualenv NK
  ~/NK/bin/pip install numpy cython numexpr tables pycuda

If installation of PyCUDA fails because some of the CUDA development files or 
libraries are not found, you may need to specify where they are explicitly. For 
example, if CUDA is installed in ``/usr/local/cuda/``, try installing PyCUDA
as follows::

  CUDA_ROOT=/usr/local/cuda/ CFLAGS=-I${CUDA_ROOT}/include \
  LDFLAGS=-L${CUDA_ROOT}/lib64 ~/NK/bin/pip install pycuda

Replace ``${CUDA_ROOT}/lib`` with ``${CUDA_ROOT}/lib64`` if your system is 
running 64-bit Linux. If you continue to encounter installation problems, see 
the `PyCUDA Wiki <http://wiki.tiker.net/PyCuda/Installation>`_ for more information.

Run the following to install the remaining Python package dependencies listed in 
`setup.py`: ::

  cd ~/neurokernel
  ~/NK/bin/python setup.py develop

Conda
^^^^^
*Note that conda packages are currently only available for 64-bit Ubuntu Linux
14.04. If you would like packages for another distribution, please submit a
request to the* |nk_developers|_.

.. _nk_developers: http://github.com/neurokernel/neurokernel/issues
.. |nk_developers| replace:: *Neurokernel developers*

First, install the ``libibverbs1``, ``libnuma1``, ``libpmi0``, ``libslurm26``, and
``libtorque2`` packages; these are required by the conda OpenMPI packages prepared
for Neurokernel. You also need to ensure that CUDA has been installed in
``/usr/local/cuda``.

Install conda by either installing `Anaconda
<https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_
or `Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_. Make sure that the
following lines appear in your `~/.condarc` file so that conda can find the
packages required by Neurokernel: ::

   channels:
   - https://conda.binstar.org/neurokernel/channel/ubuntu1404
   - defaults

Create a new conda environment containing the packages required by Neurokernel
by running the following command: ::

   conda create -n NK neurokernel_deps

Run the following to install the remaining Python package dependencies listed in 
``setup.py``: ::

  source activate NK
  cd ~/neurokernel
  python setup.py develop

Building the Documentation
--------------------------
To build Neurokerne's HTML documentation locally, you will need to install 

* `mock <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/>`_ 1.0 or later.
* `sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ 1.2 or later.
* `sphinx_rtd_theme <https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme>`_ 0.1.6 or 
  later.
 
Once these are installed, run the following: ::

  cd ~/neurokernel/docs
  make html
